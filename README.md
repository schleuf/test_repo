# test_repo
Added a bunch of examples from https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
Emoji references here https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
